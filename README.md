Evaluation of rainfall simulations over West Africa in dynamically downscaled CMIP5 global circulation models
This study assesses the ability of the Rossby Centre Regional Climate Model (RCA4), driven by nine global circulation models (GCMs), to reproduce 
the fundamental aspects of rainfall climatology over West Africa from 1980 to 2005. The seasonal climatology and annual cycle of the RCA4 
simulations were examined using observed precipitation data from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) over three homogeneous 
West African subregions (Guinea Coast, Savannah, and Sahel). Furthermore, the model output was tested using a variety of statistical 
indicators. The RCA4's interseasonal and interannual variability was investigated further across subregions and the entire West African domain.
The Mann-Kendall test revealed no significant trend in yearly rainfall in GPCP observation data or model simulations over West Africa from 1980 to 2005. 
In many ways, the HadGEM2-ES-driven RCA4 simulation performs best across the region. Adopting the multimodel ensemble mean resulted in a better 
representation of rainfall characteristics across the study domain.
